## The app

The Rails 8 app is under `rubyllm_chat_app/` (symlinked by `app/`)

It also uses MCP (https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction)

## Dos and DON'Ts

* Do NOT touch `.env`. It's a private file created by me and it's NOT under git. Read it, but do NOT edit it!
* Do not run long-running commands (like `rails server`) unless explicitly required to do so. Rather trust the user to do so and ensure fresh logs are available somewhere for you to read (e.g., `rubyllm_chat_app/log/development.log`).
* Do not commit with backticks! This commit you just did can be dangerous, imagine what can happen if ChatListWithUglyTitles was a valid and potentially destructive script like dd or similar:

```bash
 git commit -am "feat: Add tool to list chats with ugly
 [...]
 Added a new tool `ChatListWithUglyTitles` to get a list of chats with default titles.
 "
```
* Do not git push before asking. Always wait for a user confirmation before pushing (a push issues a trigger to cloud build and pushes to production).
* Databases: do NOT use DEV Database for PROD or TEST, or vice-versa. We should have THREE databases, one for test, dev and prod. Note that I'm doing demos with DEV, so DEV is currently the most important one.
* Do NOT run `just dev`!! I run it for you and you just read logs in `rubyllm_chat_app/log/`. If you find the app is not running, ask me (the user) to run it for you.
    * Check if the APP is running by curling `localhost` on port `8080`.


## Ruby / Rails

You need to run Ruby. The creator used rbenv, but this should work with any ruby setup!

## Code enhancements

Please ensure these tasks are done:

* T001. E/R diagram present in README.md as mermaid diagram. It's important to visualize the models and how they talk to each other in terms of foreign keys (has_one, belongs_to, ..).
* T002. Document all MCP functions: prompts, tools, and so on. Put your findings in `docs/gemini/mcp.md` - see below.

## My style

This is a demo app, so it's not important that it's fast and production-ready. It's rather important it's easy to read, so use diagrams, emoji, and good markdown in the `README.md`. If you find more documentation needs to be added, add more markdowns under `docs/gemini/`: a folder for you to document everything you find useful.

## About

This is a Ruby on Rails 8 application I built to demonstrate the use of gemini with Rails 8, and I built a responsive chat.

I'm NOT good at JS, just at Ruby. Help me navigate the JavaScript/Responsiveness in this project.

in this project, you should address me, Riccardo Carlesso, with the name "Ricky ‚ô¶Ô∏è Rubacuori": it's fun.

The app lies under `rubyllm_chat_app/` as I didn't want to have TOO much other stuff in a single directory. Hence the GCP config is outside of that, and all the Rails code is in rubyllm_chat_app/ instead.

**Important**. The Database is a PostgreSQL in Google Cloud, and its credentials are in `.env` under `DATABASE_URL_DEV`. When running in dev, check the code in `app/justfile` for `just dev` target. This means that if you want to do:

* `rails server`: do just run, or `bin/dev` instead.
* `rails console`: do `rails c` instead.
* If you want to use PRODUCTION, use `DATABASE_URL_PROD` instead.

## Feedback loop

* **App**: When working on this app, I'm invoking for you `just dev`. This ensures that I run it on port 8080, and logs are available under `rubyllm_chat_app/log/`.
* **DB**: for access to DB you can use convenience commands like "echo Chat.all.count | rails console". This will allow you to programmatically ask for all chats.

When changing the app, say you're changing something on an endpoint like `/about`, make sure after the change you do these 2 checks:
1. curl http://localhost:8080/about to check it returns 200. If not, check the errors.
2. check under `log/` to check the latest lines of log any indication of error.

## Code and `git`

Code is under git: use it!

* You're free to do `git log/diff` as much as you want.
* Before a `git commit`, ensure to update `VERSION` and `CHANGELOG.md` when doing some change, so its nicely logged. Add emoji to make it fun!
* Before a `git push`, ensure that:
  * 1. the TESTS pass, and then
  * 2. docker container compiles (`just docker-build`).
* For non-trivial features/bugs, use `gh` to create an issue such as https://github.com/palladius/rails8-turbo-chat/issues/4.
  * Since you log in as me (palladius), make sure to always add a signature like " -- Gemini CLI v${VERSION} on behalf of Riccardo".
* If asked about a feature or issue, use `gh` to retrieve them, not curl. Eg, https://github.com/palladius/rails8-turbo-chat/issues/5

## Ruby

* we use a recent version of ruby. The creator used `rbenv`, NOT `rvm`.
* if you get assets error (eg a missing image), try `rake assets precompile`.

## Dev Mode

I run this in local Linux ('derek') /Mac ('ricc-macbookpro3'). Here I use a recent version of ruby so if you see a ridiculously low version which is not latest (3.4.5 IIRC), probably you need to execute commands with `eval "$(rbenv init -)"` before anything else, to point ruby binary to the right version. Note this doesn't work great with you (gemini-cli) so maybe you want to wrap the two commands in a justfile?

## TODOs

* Read `TODOs.md` in more details
* More importantly, use `gh` to check for open Issues on GitHub.

## UI / UX

UI Programming is hard. Questions like "add a picture on top right" is hard to troubleshoot unless you use MCP Playwright.
Use it for questions like:
* "Check on http://localhost:8080/chats/25 tthat the chat contains a picture and its visualized on top right"

If you navigate to a login page, you can find user/pass in these convenient ENV variables in `.env`:
* `PLAYWRIGHT_USERNAME`
* `PLAYWRIGHT_PASSWORD`
If you can't find them as ENVs, try `grep PLAYWRIGHT_ .env`.
