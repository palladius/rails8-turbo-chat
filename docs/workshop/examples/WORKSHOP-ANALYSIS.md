## Inconsistencies and Unresolved Questions

*   The port number for the Rails app is inconsistently mentioned as `8080` and `8000`. This should be clarified.
*   The protocol for the MCP server is listed as `https://` in some places, which is unlikely for a local development server. It should probably be `http://`.
*   There are several internal notes and questions directed at "Christian", "Chris", "Emiliano", and "ricc" that need to be resolved before finalizing the workshop material.
